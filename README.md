# ETL-Project

<img src="images/bike_to_work.png">

For my project, I am combining data surrounding commuting to work. Different aspects I have put under the microscope include:

- Average amount of money spent annually on commuting to work in each of the 50 States (USA).
- Average distance (mi) for commute from residence to office.
- Average time spent (min) commuting one way from residence to office.
- Amount of people that ride their bikes to work.

The goal of this study is for someone to check out my cleaned and combined data and get a ball park guess of how much money they could save if they were to ride a bike (or walk) to work each day.

My study here is not intended to imply that everyone needs to ride a bike to work. However, this could be an intriguing suggestion that may help you put some more money in the bank (or...go blow money at the casino, travel, take your favorite peron to a $2,000-$5,000 dinner, etc).

There are many people that can't stand cyclists, and I can agree that there are those few who give the rest of us a bad wrap. Here is an article on Medium that gives the argument against cycling to work. Lucky for you, I can debate the opposite side on about 7 out of 8 of the points made by this article:

Anyways, if you live in the USA, check my clean data out and see if the number you could save is high enough to convince you that sitting in traffic everyday is no longer going to be a daily activity for you (weather permitting).
