# ETL-Project

For my project, I am combining data surrounding commuting to work. Different aspects I have put under the microscope include:

- Average amount of money spent annually on commuting to work in each of the 50 States (USA).
- Average distance (mi) for commute from residence to office.
- Average time spent (min) commuting one way from residence to office.
- Amount of people that ride their bikes to work.

The goal of this study is for someone to check out my cleaned and combined data and get a ball park guess of how much money they could save if they were to ride a bike (or walk) to work each day.
